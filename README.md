# Performance on server side

The project is at early stage, still in progress... Please contribute ;-)

Nevertheless the slideshow **presentation is already published at http://olibre.github.io**

The idea is to share experience feedback on these domains:
- Hardware 
- Software (C++, C++17, Boost, ...)
- Management (scm, build, dependencies...)

The C++11/C++14/C++17/C++20 part comes from the [Joel Falcou training](https://www.codereckons.com/) (see also [his old SIMD slideshow](http://www.slideshare.net/joelfalcou))

This slideshow presentation should be used as training course...
